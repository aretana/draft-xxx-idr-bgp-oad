    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document defines a new External BGP (EBGP) peering type known as
        BGP-OAD. BGP-OAD peering is used between two EBGP peers that are part
        of the same One Administrative Domain (OAD).

      <t>
	At each EBGP boundary, BGP path
	attributes are modified as
	per standard BGP rules <xref target="RFC4271"/>.  This includes prepending the AS_PATH
	attribute with the autonomous-system number of the BGP speaker
	and stripping any IBGP-only attibutes.
      </t>
      <t>
	Some networks span more than one autonomous sytem and require more
  flexibility in the propagation of path attributes. These networks are said to
  belong to One Administrative Domain (OAD). It is desiable to carry IBGP
  attributes across EBGP peering when the peers are part on OAD. This document
  defines a new EBGP peering type known as BGP-OAD. BGP-OAD peering is used
  between two EBGP peers that are part of the same OAD. This document also
  defines rules for route announcement and processing for EBGP-OAD peers.

      <t>
	<xref target="RFC4271"/> defines two types of BGP peering
	used during a BGP protocol session. As part of the
	extensions defined in this document, the EBGP peering
  is divided into two groups:
      </t>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  EBGP as defined in <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  EBGP-OAD used by two External BGP peers that are part of a same OAD
	</li>
      </ol>
      <t>
	The EBGP-OAD speaker has a BGP connection between two external
	peers in different Autonomous Systems that are part of a same OAD.
	These EBGP-OAD speakers follow the route advertisement, route
	processing, EBGP path attribute announcement and EBGP path attribute
	processing rules of the EBGP speakers as defined in
	<xref target="RFC4271"/>.
	However, the extensions defined in this document also allow EBGP-OAD
	speakers to announce and receive any IBGP-only attributes that
	were restricted to remain within an Autonomous System <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	The only IBGP feature extension that is not permitted across EBGP-OAD
	peers and is outside the scope of this document is the support for
	the Confederations <xref target="RFC5065"/>. Both the
	AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and AS_CONFED_SET <xref target="RFC5065"/>
	MUST NOT be used by members of an OAD.
      </t>
      <t>
        [Route Reflectors -- MUST NOT Cluster_List.]
      </t>
      <t>
        Unless explicitly specified, all path attributes MAY be advertised over
        an EBGP-OAD session.  The reception of any path atrribute over an
        EBGP-OAD session MUST NOT result in an error, unless it is malformed.
        It SHOULD NOT be ignored by the receiver, unless directed to by local
        policy.

      </t>
      <t>
        Unless explicitly specified, the modification of path attributes sent
        through an EBGP session remains unchanged when advertised through an
        EBGP-OAD peering.  For example, the AS_PATH is modified as specified in
        <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
  The following sections describe modifications to route advertisements
	and path attribute announcements that are specific to
	the EBGP-OAD peering.

        <section>
          <name>Nexthop Handling</name>
          <t>
            It is reasonable for EBGP-OAD peers
	    to share a common Interior Gateway
	    Protocol (IGP).  In such
	    a case, NEXT_HOP attribute and the Next Hop in the
	    MP_REACH_NLRI attribute  <xref target="RFC4760"/> MAY be left unchanged.
          </t>
      </section>

        <name>MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) Handling</name>
        <t>
          The determination of the neighboring AS for the purpose of BGP Route
          Selection <xref target="RFC4271"/> MAY also consider the ASN of the
          EBGP-OAD peer.  If so, all the peers in the receiving ASN MUST be
          conifigured to use the same criteria.

      <t>
        If multiple peerings exist between two autonomous systems in the same
        OAD, all SHOULD be configued consistently.  Improper configuration may
        result in inconsistent or unexpected forwarding.  The inconsistent use
        of EBGP-OAD sessions is out of scope of this document.

          This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
