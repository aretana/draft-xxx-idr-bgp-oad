    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document defines a new External BGP (EBGP) peering type known as
        EBGP-OAD. EBGP-OAD peering is used between two EBGP peers that are part
        of the same One Administrative Domain (OAD).

      <t>
	At each EBGP boundary, BGP path
	attributes are modified as
	per standard BGP rules <xref target="RFC4271"/>.  This includes prepending the AS_PATH
	attribute with the autonomous-system number of the BGP speaker
	and stripping any IBGP-only attibutes.
      </t>
      <t>
	Some networks span more than one autonomous system and require more
  flexibility in the propagation of path attributes. These networks are said to
  belong to One Administrative Domain (OAD). It is desirable to carry IBGP-only
  attributes across EBGP peering when the peers belong to OAD. This document
  defines a new EBGP peering type known as EBGP-OAD. EBGP-OAD peering is used
  between two EBGP peers that belong to OAD. This document also
  defines rules for route announcement and processing for EBGP-OAD peers.

      <name>Discussion</name>
      <t>
        Networks have traditionally been demarcated by an autonomous
        system (BGP border) which correlates to an administrative
        boundary. This paradigm no longer serves the needs of network
        designers or customers due to the decoupling of IGP from BGP,
        BGP-free core in the underlay (e.g. using BGP labeled unicast
        <xref target="RFC8277"/>), the use of BGP to facilitate
        multiple service overlays (e.g. L2 VPN, L3VPN) spanning
        multiple regions and AS domains, and the instantiation of
        customer sites on multiple content service providers (CSPs).
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, sites in a BGP/MPLS VPN <xref target="RFC4364"/>
	may be distributed across different AS domains. In some cases,
	the administrator of the VPN may prefer that some attributes
	are by default propagated to all their sites to influence BGP
	decision process. An example could be LOCAL_PREF which is
	ignored if received on an EBGP session <xref
	target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section>
      <name>Operation</name>
      <t>
	<xref target="RFC4271"/> defines two types of BGP peering
	used during a BGP protocol session. As part of the
	extensions defined in this document, the EBGP peering
  is divided into two groups:
      </t>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  EBGP as defined in <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  EBGP-OAD used by two External BGP peers that are part of a
	  same OAD
	</li>
      </ol>
      <t>
	The EBGP-OAD speaker has a BGP connection between two external
	peers in different Autonomous Systems that are part of a same
	OAD.  These EBGP-OAD speakers follow the route advertisement,
	route processing, EBGP path attribute announcement and EBGP
	path attribute processing rules of the EBGP speakers as
	defined in <xref target="RFC4271"/>.  However, the extensions
	defined in this document also allow EBGP-OAD speakers to
	announce and receive any IBGP-only attributes that were
	restricted to remain within an Autonomous System <xref
	target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
	The only IBGP feature extension that is not permitted across
	EBGP-OAD peers and is outside the scope of this document is
	the support for the Confederations <xref
	target="RFC5065"/>. Both the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and
	AS_CONFED_SET <xref target="RFC5065"/> MUST NOT be used by
	members of an OAD.
      </t>
      <t>
        Unless explicitly specified, all path attributes MAY be
        advertised over an EBGP-OAD session.  The reception of any
        path atrribute over an EBGP-OAD session MUST NOT result in an
        error, unless it is malformed.  It SHOULD NOT be ignored by
        the receiver, unless directed to by local policy.

      </t>
      <t>
        Unless explicitly specified, the modification of path
        attributes sent through an EBGP session remains unchanged when
        advertised through an EBGP-OAD peering.  For example, the
        AS_PATH is modified as specified in <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The following sections describe modifications to route
        advertisements and path attribute announcements that are
        specific to the EBGP-OAD peering.
      </t>

        <section>
          <name>Next Hop Handling</name>
          <t>
            It is reasonable for EBGP-OAD peers to share a common
            Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).  In such a case, NEXT_HOP
            attribute and the Next Hop in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute
            <xref target="RFC4760"/> MAY be left unchanged.
          </t>
      </section>

        <section>
          <name>Route Reflection</name>
          <t>
            BGP Route Reflection <xref target="RFC4456"/> is an
            alternative to full-mesh IBGP. The ORIGINATOR_ID and
            CLUSTER_LIST attributes MUST NOT be advertised over an
            EBGP-OAD session. If received, the procedure in <xref
            target="RFC7606"/> the same criteria.
	  </t>
	</section>
      <section>
        <name>MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) Handling</name>
        <t>
          The determination of the neighboring AS for the purpose of
          BGP Route Selection <xref target="RFC4271"/> MAY also
          consider the ASN of the EBGP-OAD peer.  If so, all the peers
          in the receiving ASN MUST be conifigured to use the same
          criteria.
        </t>
     </section>

   </section>

    <section>
      <name>Deployment and operational Considerations</name>
      <t>
        For the EBGP-OAD session to operate as expected, both BGP
        speakers MUST be configured with the same session type.  If
        only one BGP speaker is configured that way, and the other
        uses an EBGP session, the result is that some path attributes
        may be ignored and others will be discarded, but the BGP
        session will remain operational.

      </t>
      <t>
        If multiple peerings exist between two autonomous systems in the same
        OAD, all SHOULD be configured consistently.  Improper configuration may
        result in inconsistent or unexpected forwarding.  The inconsistent use
        of EBGP-OAD sessions is out of scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
	BGP Confederations [RFC5065] provide similar behavior, on a
	session by session basis, as that is specified in this
	document.  The use of confenerations and an EBGP-OAD peering
	is out of scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        The default BGP peering type for a session that is across
        autonomous systems SHOULD be EBGP. BGP implementation SHOULD
        provide configuration-time option to enable EBGP-OAD session
        type. The configuration can be in the form of a global
        statement listing the ASNs that belong to the OAD. Or, the
        configuration can be specified as a type on per-peer basis. An
        implementation may also choose to support this peering type
        option per AFI/SAFI.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Security">
        <name>Security Considerations</name>
        <t>
          This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
          inherent in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in
          <xref target="RFC4271"/> and <xref target="RFC4272"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document defines a new BGP session type which combines
          the path attribute propagation rules for EBGP and IBGP
          peering.  Any existing security considerations related to
          existing path attributes apply to the new EBGP-OAD session
          type.
	</t>
	<t>
          By combining the path attribute propagation rules, IBGP
          information may now be propagated to another autonomous
          system.  However, it is expected that the new session type
          will only be enabled when peering with a router that also
          belongs to OAD.  If misconfigured, the impact is minimal due
          to the fact that both [RFC4271] and [RFC7606] define
          mechanisms to deal with unexpected path attributes.
