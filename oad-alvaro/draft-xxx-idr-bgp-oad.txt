                      draft-xxx-idr-bgp-oad-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a new External BGP (EBGP) peering type known as
   BGP-OAD.  BGP-OAD peering is used between two EBGP peers that are
   part of the same One Administrative Domain (OAD).

1.  Introduction

   At each EBGP boundary, BGP path attributes are modified as per
   standard BGP rules [RFC4271].  This includes prepending the AS_PATH
   attribute with the autonomous-system number of the BGP speaker and
   stripping any IBGP-only attibutes.

   Some networks span more than one autonomous sytem and require more
   flexibility in the propagation of path attributes.  These networks
   are said to belong to One Administrative Domain (OAD).  It is
   desiable to carry IBGP attributes across EBGP peering when the peers
   are part on OAD.  This document defines a new EBGP peering type known
   as BGP-OAD.  BGP-OAD peering is used between two EBGP peers that are
   part of the same OAD.  This document also defines rules for route
   announcement and processing for EBGP-OAD peers.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Discussion

   [Justification TBD.  Point at use cases, etc.]

3.  Operation

   [RFC4271] defines two types of BGP peering used during a BGP protocol
   session.  As part of the extensions defined in this document, the
   EBGP peering is divided into two groups:

   1.  EBGP as defined in [RFC4271].

   2.  EBGP-OAD used by two External BGP peers that are part of a same
       OAD

   The EBGP-OAD speaker has a BGP connection between two external peers
   in different Autonomous Systems that are part of a same OAD.  These
   EBGP-OAD speakers follow the route advertisement, route processing,
   EBGP path attribute announcement and EBGP path attribute processing
   rules of the EBGP speakers as defined in [RFC4271].  However, the
   extensions defined in this document also allow EBGP-OAD speakers to
   announce and receive any IBGP-only attributes that were restricted to
   remain within an Autonomous System [RFC4271].

   The only IBGP feature extension that is not permitted across EBGP-OAD
   peers and is outside the scope of this document is the support for
   the Confederations [RFC5065].  Both the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and
   AS_CONFED_SET [RFC5065] MUST NOT be used by members of an OAD.

   [Route Reflectors -- MUST NOT Cluster_List.]

   Unless explicitly specified, all path attributes MAY be advertised
   over an EBGP-OAD session.  The reception of any path atrribute over
   an EBGP-OAD session MUST NOT result in an error, unless it is
   malformed.  It SHOULD NOT be ignored by the receiver, unless directed
   to by local policy.

   Unless explicitly specified, the modification of path attributes sent
   through an EBGP session remains unchanged when advertised through an
   EBGP-OAD peering.  For example, the AS_PATH is modified as specified
   in [RFC4271].

   The following sections describe modifications to route advertisements
   and path attribute announcements that are specific to the EBGP-OAD
   peering.

3.1.  Nexthop Handling

   It is reasonable for EBGP-OAD peers to share a common Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP).  In such a case, NEXT_HOP attribute and the
   Next Hop in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute [RFC4760] MAY be left
   unchanged.

3.2.  MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) Handling

   The determination of the neighboring AS for the purpose of BGP Route
   Selection [RFC4271] MAY also consider the ASN of the EBGP-OAD peer.
   If so, all the peers in the receiving ASN MUST be conifigured to use
   the same criteria.  [Clarify + Example]

3.3.  ORIGINATOR_ID Handling

3.4.  Label Allocation and Label Handling

4.  Deployment Considerations

   If multiple peerings exist between two autonomous systems in the same
   OAD, all SHOULD be configued consistently.  Improper configuration
   may result in inconsistent or unexpected forwarding.  The
   inconsistent use of EBGP-OAD sessions is out of scope of this
   document.

   [Management / Configuration Text needed.]

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in
   [RFC4271] and [RFC4272].

   [Add more.  Backwards -- one sided!]
