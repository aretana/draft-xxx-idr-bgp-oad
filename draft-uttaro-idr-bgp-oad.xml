    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document defines a new External BGP (EBGP) peering type known as
        EBGP-OAD. EBGP-OAD peering is used between two EBGP peers that belong to
        One Administrative Domain (OAD).

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        At each EBGP boundary, BGP path attributes are modified as per standard
        BGP rules <xref target="RFC4271"/>.  This includes prepending the
        AS_PATH attribute with the autonomous-system number of the BGP speaker
        and stripping any IBGP-only attributes.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some networks span more than one autonomous system and require more
        flexibility in the propagation of path attributes. These networks are
        said to belong to One Administrative Domain (OAD). It is desirable to
        carry IBGP-only attributes across EBGP peering when the peers belong to
        OAD. This document defines a new EBGP peering type known as EBGP-OAD.
        EBGP-OAD peering is used between two EBGP peers that belong to OAD.
        This document also defines rules for route announcement and processing
        for EBGP-OAD peers.

      <name>Discussion</name>
      <t>
        Networks have traditionally been demarcated by an autonomous system/BGP
        border which correlates to an administrative boundary. This paradigm no
        longer serves the needs of network designers or customers due to the
        decoupling of IGP from BGP, BGP-free core in the underlay (e.g. using
        BGP labeled unicast <xref target="RFC8277"/>), the use of BGP to
        facilitate multiple service overlays (e.g., L2VPN, L3VPN, etc.)
        spanning multiple regions and AS domains, and the instantiation of
        customer sites on multiple content service providers (CSPs).
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, sites in a BGP/MPLS VPN <xref target="RFC4364"/> may be
        distributed across different AS domains. In some
        cases, the administrator of the VPN may prefer that some attributes are
        propagated to all their sites to influence the BGP decision process. An
        example could be LOCAL_PREF which is ignored if received on an EBGP
        session <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section>
      <name>Operation</name>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC4271"/> defines two types of BGP peerings used during
        a BGP protocol session. As part of the extensions defined in this
        document, the EBGP peering is divided into two types:
      </t>
      <ol>
	    <li>EBGP as defined in <xref target="RFC4271"/>.</li>
	    <li>EBGP-OAD as defined below.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>
        The EBGP-OAD session is a BGP connection between two external peers in
        different Autonomous Systems that belong to OAD. In general, the
        EBGP-OAD speakers follow the EBGP route advertisement, route
        processing, path attribute announcement and processing rules as defined
        in <xref target="RFC4271"/>. However, EBGP-OAD speakers are also
        allowed to announce and receive any IBGP-only or non-transitive
        attributes that were restricted to remain within an Autonomous System
        <xref target="RFC4271"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Unless explicitly specified, all path attributes MAY be advertised over
        an EBGP-OAD session.  The reception of any path attribute over an
        EBGP-OAD session MUST NOT result in an error, unless it is malformed.
        Received path attributes SHOULD NOT be ignored by the receiver, unless
        directed to by local policy.
      </t>
      <t>
        Unless explicitly specified, the current processes for the
        advertisement of path attributes remains unchanged when advertised
        through an EBGP-OAD peering.  The process for EBGP advertisement MUST
        take priority over the process for IBGP advertisement.  For example,
        the AS_PATH attribute is modified as specified in Section 5.1.2 of
        <xref target="RFC4271"/>, bullet b ("BGP speaker advertises the route
        to an external peer").
      </t>
      <t>
        An EBGP-OAD speaker MUST support four-octet AS numbers and avertize the
        "support for four-octet AS number capability" <xref target="RFC6793"/> .
      </t>
      <t>
        The following sections describe modifications to route advertisements
        and path attribute announcements that are specific to the EBGP-OAD
        peering.
      </t>

        <section>
          <name>Next Hop Handling</name>
          <t>
            It is reasonable for EBGP-OAD peers to share a common Interior
            Gateway Protocol (IGP).  In such a case, NEXT_HOP attribute and the
            Next Hop in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute  <xref target="RFC4760"/>
            MAY be left unchanged.
          </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="MED">
        <name>MULTI_EXIT_DISC (MED) Handling</name>
        <t>
          The determination of the neighboring AS for the purpose of BGP Route
          Selection <xref target="RFC4271"/> MAY also consider the ASN of the
          EBGP-OAD peer.  If so, all the peers in the receiving ASN MUST be
          configured to use the same criteria.
        </t>
     </section>
     <section>
       <name>Route Reflection</name>
       <t>
         BGP Route Reflection <xref target="RFC4456"/> is an alternative to
         full-mesh IBGP.  The ORIGINATOR_ID and CLUSTER_LIST attributes MUST
         NOT be advertised over an EBGP-OAD session.  If received, the
         procedures in <xref target="RFC7606"/> apply.
       </t>
     </section>
   </section>

    <section>
      <name>Deployment and Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>
        For the EBGP-OAD session to operate as expected, both BGP speakers MUST
        be configured with the same session type.  If only one BGP speaker is
        configured that way, and the other uses an EBGP session, the result is
        that some path attributes may be ignored and others will be discarded,
        but the BGP session will remain operational.
      </t>
      <t>
        The default BGP peering type for a session that is across autonomous
        systems SHOULD be EBGP.  BGP implementation SHOULD provide a
        configuration-time option to enable the EBGP-OAD session type.  If the
        session type is changed once the BGP connection has been established,
        the BGP speaker MUST readvertise its entire Adj-RIB-Out to its peer.
        Requesting a route refresh <xref target="RFC7313"/> is RECOMMENDED.
      </t>
      <t>
        The requirement that Import and Export Policies exist
        <xref target="RFC8212"/> SHOULD be disabled if both peers are
        configured with the EBGP-OAD session type.
      </t>
      <t>
        If multiple peerings exist between two autonomous systems that belong
        to OAD, all SHOULD be configured consistently.  Improper configuration
        may result in inconsistent or unexpected forwarding.  The inconsistent
        use of EBGP-OAD sessions is out of scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        BGP Confederations <xref target="RFC5065"/> provide similar behavior,
        on a session by session basis, as what is specified in this document.
        The use of confederations with an EBGP-OAD peering is out of scope of
        this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        The consideration of the ASN of the EBGP-OAD peer to determine the
        neighboring AS for MED comparison <xref target="MED"/> may result in
        the creation persistent route oscillations, similar to the Type II
        Churn described in <xref target="RFC3345"/>.  <xref target="RFC7964"/>
        provides solutions and recommendations to address this issue.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Security">
        <name>Security Considerations</name>
        <t>
          This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
          inherent in the existing BGP protocol, such as those described in
          <xref target="RFC4271"/> and <xref target="RFC4272"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          This document defines a new BGP session type which combines the path
          attribute propagation rules for EBGP and IBGP peering.  Any existing
          security considerations related to existing path attributes apply to
          the new EBGP-OAD session type.
        </t>
        <t>
          By combining the path attribute propagation rules, IBGP information
          may now be propagated to another autonomous system.  However, it is
          expected that the new session type will only be enabled when peering
          with a router that also belongs to OAD.  If misconfigured, the impact
          is minimal due to the fact that both <xref target="RFC4271"/> and
          <xref target="RFC7606"/> define mechanisms to deal with unexpected
          path attributes.
